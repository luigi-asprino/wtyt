# Who told you that?

## Motivation
The Linked Data Web has grown into a compendium of billions of facts. While some of the knowledge bases available on the Data Web have been curated manually, several of the facts available have been shown to be wrong. The aim of this project is to detect evidence for triples on the Web, i.e., web pages that support that a triple is true. To this end, input triples provided by a user are first to be verbalized. Then the verbalization are to be searched for using a standard search engine (e.g., Google) and the returned documents are to be shown to the user (possibly with the evidence for the triple in the document).

## Scope
This mini-project is the work of the Orange Stampede group during the Summer School of Semantic Web, 5-11 July 2015, Bertinoro (FC), Italy.
